<p>Garbage collection aka GC is one of the most important features of Java. Garbage collection is the mechanism used in Java to de-allocate unused memory, which is nothing but clear the space consumed by unused objects. To deallocate unused memory, Garbage collector track all the objects that are still in use and it marks the rest of the object as garbage. Basically garbage collector use Mark and Sweep algorithm to clear unused memory.</p>
